==========next steps=======

**saving temperaments and settings to localstorage
https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp

what settings to save, and when?
save current temperament - all the rules explicitly, so it can be a temperament 'in progress', not saved yet. Resave after each recalculate? That's a bit redundant.. might be simplest, but more efficient to just do it when a rule changes.
save current note and volume on each change.
startingNote and frequency on each change
saved temperaments - add when saving.



**importing/exporting to/from text boxes
(global for switching to another computer, and just a temperament for sending one to someone)

**link button - send a link to your current page - same settings, same temperament (but not all your saved temperaments). Just needs current frequency/startingnote and all the temperament rules.
(disable when local file:// url)

**"help/about" page with version info, home page link, author, etc

**spiff up interface, esp for phones, with specialized keyboardpopups**

**make it look nice with some more css

**popup "keyboard" to make entry easier, especially on phones. for notes, a row of 7 buttons for notename and 4 for accidental. Even radio buttons could work there, actually.
for fractions, something similar, maybe?

INITIAL RELEASE (?)



**add more data to the table besides frequency and cents (5th above size, major third size, minor third, etc..)
change rules list into a table, just to make formatting easier, and to have table headings to describe the fields

**chord mode

**beat visualization

**add more visualizations - graph via canvas (or make svgs???)


=========interface==========

simplify - make an interface that will be easy for keyboards and phones, and have less to worry about.

all the checking can be done upon entry.

popup a special 'keyboard' for each field, with suggestions along the top, and buttons below.

so for a note, it has notes A-G, and #, b, bb, x. Along the top, suggest a the most likely - in a note1, suggest the last note2, note2, suggest a fifth and major third, up and down. for startingnote, just suggest A and C, since no one uses much else very often. Frequency, recently used frequencies, and 415, 415.3, 430, 440, 466, 392. Fractions, suggest last used, then -1/4, -1/5, -1/6, -1/12. Keyboard needs -, numbers, period, and slash.

Then only allow input with the special keyboard, but also watch for keypresses (only the ones in the box).




always have a blank rule - so get rid of the 'new rule' button. Calculate as soon as there are two notes available, and then any time something changes...?
maybe not... 
make a way to 'tab' to the next field, on a phone. Each 'keyboard' needs a 'next' button, which jumps forwards.


===========temperament list=============

Maybe at some point, it'd be nice to sort them different ways - name, degree of inequality, category/type? (circulating, near-equal, meantone, mod-meantone, etc)

==========table============
a button for "switch 0 point of cents deviation", then just click on a note in the table.

interval stuff needs to figure out *which* interval, in the case of enharmonic stuff. Use the one spelled properly, if it's there, otherwise, use the enharmonic if it's there, otherwise, leave blank.

=========temperament editor=========

need to implement cents input somehow.

==============playback==============
also, should the table display the frequencies for the current octave, or just starting from the startingFreq? Maybe a 2nd column for "currnet playback pitch" or something, if that's useful?
also highlight the current note in the table
keyboard shortcut for next/prev note and octave

option for waveform - sine, triangle, custom (?)

chord mode (lets you select the notes (and modify each one's octave) - in the table list, or elsewhere? Step up/down chords would be nice!

=============save/export/import=======
save button

save to local storage with current info - current temperament, etc. after each edit/load so that it remembers the current setup.

export current temperaments, or all local temperaments (show the json export info in a popup text box, for copying and pasting into an e-mail.)


===========checkRule=================
needs to check for duplicates and conflicts. How? maybe calculate every rule, even if we have both its notes, and then mark it as used. If we have the note already, just verify that it's the same frequency (or close enough). If not, toss out an error, highlighting all the rules with that note.

============compatibility==============
input type="range" only supported as of v10 in IE... used for volume. Make a custom slider instead?
