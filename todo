==========next steps=======

need to validate note/frequency...



**make drop-down suggestions
notes: 
list of notes. For note1, make the first choice the previous note2
Once you've typed a notename, suggest its accidentals

fraction:
suggest first the last used fraction
then a list of -1/4, -1/5, -1/6, -1/12
no need to put in anything special for thirds, since they are almost never tuned except pure.




**saving temperaments and settings to localstorage
https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp

**importing/exporting to/from text boxes
(global for switching to another computer, and just a temperament for sending one to someone)

**link button - send a link to your current page - same settings, same temperament (but not all your saved temperaments). Just needs current frequency/startingnote and all the temperament rules.
(disable when local file:// url)

**"help/about" page with version info, home page link, author, etc

**make it look nice with some more css

**popup "keyboard" to make entry easier, especially on phones. for notes, a row of 7 buttons for notename and 4 for accidental. Even radio buttons could work there, actually.
for fractions, something similar, maybe?

INITIAL RELEASE (?)



**add more data to the table besides frequency and cents (5th above size, major third size, minor third, etc..)
change rules list into a table, just to make formatting easier, and to have table headings to describe the fields

**chord mode

**beat visualization

**add more visualizations - graph via canvas (or make svgs???)


===========temperament list=============

Maybe at some point, it'd be nice to sort them different ways - name, degree of inequality, category/type? (circulating, near-equal, meantone, mod-meantone, etc)

===========organization================
variables - one big one for tuning rules, and another for calculated note info (to start, just save the frequencies)

maybe a few other variables that get saved/restored from local storage for configuration - waveform, octave break location. Either a config popup page lists them, or else just boxes where appropriate (next to table for octave break, near playback for waveform...)


==========table============
a button for "switch 0 point of cents deviation", then just click on a note in the table.

interval stuff needs to figure out *which* interval, in the case of enharmonic stuff. Use the one spelled properly, if it's there, otherwise, use the enharmonic if it's there, otherwise, leave blank.

=========temperament editor=========

need to implement cents input somehow.

temperament name
description

======starting note/frequency========
give a list of typical frequencies for that note, + last 4-5 most recent

==============playback==============
also, should the table display the frequencies for the current octave, or just starting from the startingFreq? Maybe a 2nd column for "currnet playback pitch" or something, if that's useful?
also highlight the current note in the table
keyboard shortcut for next/prev note and octave

option for waveform

chord mode (lets you select the notes (and modify each one's octave) - in the table list, or elsewhere? Step up/down chords would be nice!

=============save/export/import=======
save button

save to local storage with current info - current temperament, etc. after each edit/load so that it remembers the current setup.

export current temperaments, or all local temperaments (show the json export info in a popup text box, for copying and pasting into an e-mail.)


===========checkRule=================
needs to check for duplicates and valid intervals (p5/M3 and inversions for now)

============compatibility==============
input type="range" only supported as of v10 in IE...
